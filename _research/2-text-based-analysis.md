In this set of research projects, I use textual analysis to measure innovation, examine the heterogenous impact of innovation on firm performance, and explore the use of textual analysis in innnovation and management research.

## Working Paper

A text-based measurement of innovation<br/>

<ul>In this paper, I construct a novel measurement of innovation activity using the financial document of publicly listed firms from 2007 to 2018. This text-based measurement of innovation describes the information of the innovation process, including innovation inputs, innovation throughputs, and innovation outputs. Such measurement is avaialable for all public-listed firms, regardless of whether they are patenting and investing in R&D (research and development). I also explore the heterogeneous impact of different stages of the innovation process on firm performance.</ul><br/>

<ul>Keywords: innovation, patent, R&D, textual analysis</ul>
