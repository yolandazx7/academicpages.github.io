I developed my interest in teaching since my first undergraduate teaching assistant experience with the first course in the sequence of the Intermediate Microeconomics. I was chosen as the peer tutor in the following semester to help develop and experiment the Peer Tutoring Lab at UCSD Department of Economics. Due to the high level of student engagement in our experiment, this tutroing lab succesfully transited into a funded long-term program to help all the undergraduates in Economics with intermediate level courses.
