Welcome to my personal website! I am a Ph.D. Candidate of the [Dyson School of Applied Economics & Management](https://dyson.cornell.edu/) at Cornell University. I am an applied economist by training and an experienced researcher with strong modeling, data analytics and programming skills in STATA, Python, R, and MATLAB. My expertise focuses on innovation and strategy. I earned my M.S. in Applied Economics and Management at Cornell University and my B.S. in Joint Mathematics-Economics at University of California, San Diego. <br/>

My research interest is economics of intellectual property and innovation, corporate innovation strategy, and digitization and digital platform strategy. My research develops novel methods to measure innovation, explores the fundamental forces that drive firms' decisions on public disclosure of innovation activities, and investigates how patent right enforcement impacts innovation disclosure.
